# Predictive Analytics in Healthcare

This project explores healthcare cost drivers using statistical analysis and introductory machine learning techniques. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model comparison, and clear visual communication of results.

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Identify key predictors of healthcare costs  
- Compare multiple modeling approaches  
- Build a clean, reproducible analysis workflow  
- Communicate insights through visualizations  

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `data/` — sample or synthetic data (no sensitive data)  
- `notebooks/` — exploration and modeling notebooks  
- `src/` — reusable Python scripts for cleaning and modeling  
- `reports/` — figures and summary outputs  

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)  
- Data cleaning & transformation  
- Feature engineering  
- Regression modeling  
- Visualization  

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add model evaluation metrics  
- Add visualizations to `reports/figures`  
- Expand feature engineering
